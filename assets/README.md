## Using Assets

The current project expects an Assets directory that contains these files. The program will not work if this folder is not present:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G9uy1Alj_zZPU7BBOiipEnXu2eRSTVkX?usp=sharing

Currently supported formats for models include .obj and .gltf. 
Currently supported formats for textures include .png and .jpg.

Since the project uses assimp and stb_mage, more types of models/textures should work.
